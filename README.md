# Getting Started 
This code is a JavaScript implementation of encrypting and decrypting files using the Lit Protocol SDK. It uses the LitNodeClient to connect to the Lit Protocol network and encrypts files using the encryptFile() method. The accessControlConditions array is used to specify the conditions that must be met to access the encrypted file. The decryptFile() method is used to decrypt the encrypted file using the symmetric key. The app.js file is a React application that uses the Lit.js file to encrypt and decrypt files. It allows the user to select a file, encrypt it, and then decrypt it.

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`

then: 

### `npm start`
